            The system doesnâ€™t store the document itself but a hash of it. This
            hash is a cryptographic representation that changes with any
            modification to the document, allowing verification of its
            integrity.

            Blockchain records are visible and accessible to all users, allowing
            for public verification of document timestamps without relying on a
            central authority. This increases transparency and builds trust
            among users.

            Since blockchains are inherently tamper-resistant, once a document's
            hash is stored on the blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted.
            This ensures a permanent and trustworthy record of the document's
            existence.

            Only the hash of the document is stored on the blockchain, not the
            document itself. This prevents sensitive information from being
            publicly accessible while still allowing verifiable proof of
            existence.
